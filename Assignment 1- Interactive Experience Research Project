<h1>Assingment 1: Interactive Experience Research Project</h1>
<img src="" alt="">

<h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h1>

<p>The website contained varias unique animations components like the unique transitions as the user scrolls and text that changes font or shape as the the cursor hovers. The one component that stood out to me the most was the morphing text at the start of the webpage. I had played around with the morphing text at the start of the 8th website. </p>

<h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>

<ul>
    <li>On the very first section of the page, a baclground immage slowly shifts and follows the direction of the mouse.</li>
    <li>After the unique image interactiom, I scrolled downwards. As I scrolled several smooth transitions occured.</li>
    <li>Also encoutered morphing texts throughout the webpage.</li>
    <li>Lastly, at the end of the website, a cinematic 3D model was displayed. This contained transitions as if the individual was at the image's location.</li>
  </ul>

<h4> What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>

<p>I spent the most time scrolling through the website because of the unique transitions from short passages to the images. The webpage images consisted of multiple cinematic components like the opera house as well as smooth zoom transitions from to create a sense of direction through the images and text passages.</p>

<h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h5>

<p>The most common action in my two minute experience was scrolling through the cenimatic 3d images. These 3D components contained parts where the scrolling gave a sense of direction through the images as if you were at the images' location.</p>

<h4> What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h6>

<p> The primary goal of the webpage was to persuade the reader to explore through it and possibly visist the sydney opera house. The unique animations of the text sections as I scrolled stood out the most on the website. Also the unique text changing font as one moves your cursor over the text added a more intresting interactive experience.</p>

<h3> How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h7>

<p>During the experience, with both the unique scrolling animations and changing text font communicates a fun interactive website to look through. These components help attract people to also learn more about the place and ultimately with the goal of influencing people to visit the sydney opera house.</p>

<h8>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </h8>

<p> Throughout the experience, the unique scrolling animations through texts and images was used as the overall design of the webpage. The 3D interactive elements as you scroll are the key components of the webpage, help empahsize the overall theme of the syndney opera house.</p>

<h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h9>

<p>The interactive experience is designed for individuals to spend lots of time reading through the website. The changing text may help individuals read through the webpage.</p>

<h4>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h10>

<p>The webpage does not refrence other media forms. However, the website does refrence the sketches, 3D modeling and the overall building design of the syndey opera house. The key component that was emphasized was the design and creation of the organ instrument in the sydney operahouse.</p>

<h11>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h11>

<p>The webpage refrences the user to engage through the scrolling portions and try to influence people to go to the opera house to have a wonderful experience.</p>

<h12>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h12>

<p>This webpage communicates a sense of amazement as the user scrolls through the short sections of text and unique images. This webpage goal is to persuade individuals to visit the syndey opera house.</p>

<h13>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h13>

<p>Though the webpage is scrolling based and has unique transitions from the text to images, any individual may get tired of scrolling through it. This scrolling based webpage with animations can get repetitive and boring, reducing the number of people visiting the website.</p>

<h14>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h14>

<p>The most satisfying part would be how the text changes as the cursor hovers over the text. At the start the text distorts and changes font as you hover over the text with the cursor.</p>
